# Chapter 3. Common Programming Concepts
- Covers common PLC and how they work in Rust
- Specific topics include: variables, basic types, functions, comments, and control flow
- Like most languages, Rust has a set of predefined reserved words or keywords

# Appendix A: Keywords

### Familiar Keywords
 - `as`: perform primitive casting, disambiguate the specific trait containing an item, or rename items in use and extern crate statements
 - `async`: return a Future instead of blocking the current thread
 - `await`: suspend execution until the result of a Future is ready
 - `break`: exit a loop immediately
 - `const`: define constant items or constant raw pointers
 - `continue`: continue to the next loop iteration
 - `else`: fallback for if and if let control flow constructs
 - `enum`: define an enumeration
 - `false`: Boolean false literal
 - `for`: loop over items from an iterator, implement a trait, or specify a higher-ranked lifetime
 - `if`: branch based on the result of a conditional expression
 - `in`: part of for loop syntax
 - `let`: bind a variable
 - `return`: return from function
 - `Self`: a type alias for the type we are defining or implementing
 - `self`: method subject or current module
 - `static`: global variable or lifetime lasting the entire program execution
 - `struct`: define a structure
 - `super`: parent module of the current module
 - `true`: Boolean true literal
 - `union`: define a union and is only a keyword when used in a union declaration
 - `use`: bring symbols into scope
 - `while`: loop conditionally based on the result of an expression

### New Keywords 
- `crate`: link an external crate or a macro variable representing the crate in which the macro is defined
- `dyn`: dynamic dispatch to a trait object
- `extern`: link an external crate, function, or variable
- `fn`: define a function or the function pointer type
- `impl`: implement inherent or trait functionality
- `loop`: loop unconditionally
- `match`: match a value to patterns
- `mod`: define a module
- `move`: make a closure take ownership of all its captures
- `mut`: denote mutability in references, raw pointers, or pattern bindings
- `pub`: denote public visibility in struct fields, impl blocks, or modules
- `ref`: bind by reference
- `trait`: define a trait
- `type`: define a type alias or associated type
- `unsafe`: denote unsafe code, functions, traits, or implementations
- `where`: denote clauses that constrain a type
