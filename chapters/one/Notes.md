# Chapter 1.3 Hello, Cargo!

## Cargo Basics

1. `cargo new` - lets you create a project.
2. `cargo build` - lets you build a project.
3. `cargo run` - lets you  build and run a project in one step.
4. `cargo check` lets you check for errors by building a project without producing a binary.
5. `target/debug` - Cargo saves the result of a build in the `target/debug` folder instead of the same directory as our code.
